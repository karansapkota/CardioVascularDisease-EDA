# Data
The dataset consists of 70 000 records of patients data in 12 features, such as age, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and etc. The target class "cardio" equals to 1, when patient has cardiovascular desease, and it's 0, if patient is healthy.

# Task 
The task is to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the patient examination results.

# Results

 Here we can see that people over age 55 have high chance of having cardio vascular disease(CVD).

 It can be clearly seen that patients with CVD have higher cholesterol and blood glucose level. And, generally speaking less active.

 We can see age and cholesterol have significant impact, but not very high correlated with target class.
